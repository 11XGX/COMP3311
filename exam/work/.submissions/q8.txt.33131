# COMP3311 12s1 Exam Q8

(a)
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    position text NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE PartTime (
    employee_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES Employees(id),
    fraction float NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
)

CREATE TABLE Casual (
    employee_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES Employees(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id)
)

CREATE TABLE Hours (
    employee_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES Casual(employee_id),
    date date NOT NULL,
    starting time NOT NULL,
    ending time NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE (employee_id, date)
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, date)
    
)

We presume that the PartTime and Casual tuples link to exactly one Employee and conversely, one Employee has a single role defined by their position and disjoint relationship with a PartTime OR Casual entry.
A Casual employee may or may not have hours recorded for when they worked.  However, Hours should be associated to one Casual employee with an associated date and times.
Finally, by ensuring we have a unique combination of employee_id and date (our Hours primary key), we ensure they only work for one time period on any given day.

(b)
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    name text NOT NULL,
    position text NOT NULL,
    fraction float,
    starting time,
    ending time,
    date date
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

We have one entry for each Part-time employee and one to many entries for each Casual employee.
